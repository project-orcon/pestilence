#### Use Camera Component
Camera component asks for user permissions to display inline camera for taking pictures, if not granted or if camera doesn't exist a file picker is displayed. 

 ``` <Camera v-model="files" :rules="imageRules"></Camera>
 ```


 - files array contains image file (single file for moment), 
 - imageRules is an array of functions that return error strings used to validate that image exists.  
 - add negative margin to make fullscreen. 

Camera component is adjusted to full screen using the following css, change to suit page. 
 .camera_on {
margin: 0 -24px !important;
}
